vim-linux
=========

This is a repo for plugins and vim config for linux distributions that I have control over what version of vim and other tools that I use with vim.  (Python3, Jslint, node, etc.) 

I have a vim hosted repo that is for my hosted environments, where I don't have full control over what tools I have at my disposal.
